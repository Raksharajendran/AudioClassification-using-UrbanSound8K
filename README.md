# AudioClassification-using-UrbanSound8K
Welcome to the Audio Classification with UrbanSound8K repository! This project showcases the use of deep learning techniques to classify urban sound clips into various categories using the UrbanSound8K dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and preparing the UrbanSound8K dataset for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Implementation of state-of-the-art neural network architectures tailored for audio classification.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Code for training the model with support for validation and testing on unseen data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques for extracting relevant audio features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing audio data, model performance metrics, and training history.
